## 🎯 Executive Summary

This **Real-Time Bike Rental Demand Forecasting System** solves a critical business problem for bike-sharing platforms operating across entire cities. The system provides hour-ahead demand predictions that drive dynamic pricing strategies, enabling revenue optimization and improved fleet utilization.


## Business Problem Solved

**Challenge**: Bike-sharing platforms need to optimize dynamic pricing based on predicted demand to:
- **Maximize Revenue**: Increase prices during high-demand surges
- **Stimulate Demand**: Lower prices during slow periods to attract riders
- **Optimize Fleet**: Better plan supply-demand balance and bike distribution

**Solution**: A real-time ML system that forecasts city-wide bike rental demand for the next hour, enabling:
- **Dynamic Pricing Optimization**: Real-time price adjustments based on demand forecasts
- **Incentive Campaigns**: Targeted promotions during predicted low-demand periods
- **Operational Planning**: Improved fleet utilization and supply-demand balance

### End-to-End ML Pipeline Architecture

The system implements a comprehensive machine learning pipeline with five distinct stages:

#### 1. **Preprocessing Pipeline**
- **Column Renaming**: Configurable column mapping for data standardization
- **Column Dropping**: Removal of unnecessary columns based on configuration
- **Data Reset**: Index reset for clean data structure
- **Configuration-Driven**: All preprocessing steps controlled via config parameters

#### 2. **Feature Engineering Pipeline**
- **Lag Features**: Creation of time-lagged features for time series forecasting
- **Configurable Lags**: Multiple lag periods (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 5, 10 periods) for different features
- **Backward Fill**: Handling of missing values in lag features using bfill method
- **Feature Naming**: Automatic naming convention: `{feature}_lag_{period}`

#### 3. **Training Pipeline**
- **Target Creation**: Shifted target variable for forecasting (configurable shift period)
- **Time-Series Split**: Train-test split without shuffling to preserve temporal order
- **CatBoost Model**: Gradient boosting regressor with configurable parameters
- **Optuna Hyperparameter Tuning**: Automated optimization of learning_rate, depth, and l2_leaf_reg
- **Early Stopping**: Prevents overfitting with configurable early stopping rounds
- **Time-Based Validation**: Manual validation split within training data

#### 4. **Inference Pipeline**
- **Model Loading**: Dynamic model loading from specified path
- **Single Prediction**: Returns only the last prediction value for real-time forecasting
- **Feature Preparation**: Input DataFrame processing for model inference
- **Timestamp Integration**: Current timestamp handling for prediction tracking

#### 5. **Postprocessing Pipeline**
- **Model Persistence**: Automated model saving after training
- **Prediction Formatting**: Single-row DataFrame with timestamp and prediction columns
- **Time Increment**: Configurable time increment for prediction timestamps
- **Data Structure**: Standardized output format for downstream processing

### 🐳 Entrypoints
- **`app-ml/train.py`**: Model training entrypoint boith locally and in production
- **`app-ml/inference.py`** Entrypoint to run inference pipeline locally
- **`app-ml/inference-api.py`**: API for inference in production / on web-app
- **`app-ui/app.py`**: Interactive dashboard for demand reocasting monitoring
